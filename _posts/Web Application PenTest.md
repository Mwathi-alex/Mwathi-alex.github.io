In this project, I performed a web application penetration test against a vulnerable lab environment.  

###  Scope
- Test user authentication, input handling, and database queries.  

###  Tools
- **Burp Suite** for interception and manipulation.  
- **Nikto** for web server scanning.  
- **SQLmap** for automated SQL injection.  

###  Findings
- Discovered SQL Injection in the login form.  
- Identified reflected XSS on the search page.  

###  Outcome
Proposed mitigation strategies, including input sanitization, parameterized queries, and proper session management.
